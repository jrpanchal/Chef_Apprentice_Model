## Types of Modeling 

### 1) Regression Model Development 

I was tasked with using the information in our course case to build a predictive model on a continuous response variable (Y-variable). This assignment encompasses feature engineering, model preparation, variable selection, and model development.

#### Final score
0.8041

Model Used in this analysis : OLS Regression (standard linear regression)
Lasso Regression
Bayesian Automatic Relevance Determination (ARD)
K-Nearest Neighbors Regression (KNN)

### 2) Classification Model Development 

I was tasked with using the information in our course case to build a predictive model on a binary response variable (Y-variable). This assignment encompasses feature engineering, model preparation, variable selection, and model development.

#### Final AUC score
0.8612

Model Used in this analysis: Logistic Regression
K-Nearest Neighbors Classification (KNN)
Classification Trees
Random Forest (Classification)
Gradient Boosted Models (GBM)
